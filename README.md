# ü©∫ Rehcura ‚Äì AI Clinical Note Triage & Analytics Prototype

## üí° Inspiration

I was inspired by the immense administrative burden faced by healthcare professionals today. While EHRs like Epic and Cerner are powerful, they often lead to information overload. I saw an opportunity to use AI and NLP to automate the critical, yet tedious, task of triaging clinical notes, helping clinicians save time and prioritize urgent patient care.

## ‚ú® What it does

**Rehcura** is a hackathon prototype that analyzes and triages clinical notes using AI. It can:

-   **Triage Notes:** Automatically classifies notes by urgency (Low, Medium, High) and medical topic.
-   **Generate Summaries:** Creates AI-generated audio and text summaries for quick, hands-free review.
-   **Visualize Data:** Produces word clouds and an interactive analytics dashboard for quick insights from patient data in a CSV file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How I built it

I built the project using **Python**, creating a pipeline that integrates several libraries. I used **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze the note text. For the user interface, I chose **Gradio** because it allowed me to quickly build an interactive, shareable web app. I used **pandas** to handle data and **Plotly** and **WordCloud** for visualization. The audio features were built using **SpeechRecognition** for input and **gTTS** for output.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Challenges I ran into

The main challenge was the lack of a large, pre-labeled dataset for clinical notes. I had to combine a small labeled dataset with a rule-based system to make the AI model functional for the prototype. Another challenge was managing the project scope within a limited timeframe, which meant focusing on a core, demonstrable set of features rather than attempting full-scale EHR integration.

## üéâ Accomplishments I'm proud of

I am most proud of creating a working prototype that successfully demonstrates a clear, real-world application of AI in healthcare. It's a comprehensive solution, not just a single feature. I'm also proud that I was able to build the entire project on my own, from the backend logic to the front-end interface, all within the hackathon's time limit.

## üß† What I learned

I learned a tremendous amount about the nuances of applying AI to a specialized field like medicine. I discovered that a simple, elegant UI is crucial for user adoption, especially in high-stress environments. Most importantly, I learned the value of effective scoping and rapid prototyping to turn a complex idea into a functional demo.

## üöÄ What's next for Rehcura

The next steps for Rehcura would be to move beyond the prototype phase. This includes:

-   **Secure Integration:** Developing secure, API-based integration with real EHR systems like **Epic** and **Cerner**.
-   **Advanced Analytics:** Building more robust analytics and predictive models for a deeper understanding of patient trends.
-   **Clinical Validation:** Collaborating with healthcare professionals to validate the urgency scoring and other AI outputs to ensure they are medically sound and reliable.
